1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

`Describe() is used to break down your test suite into components, whereas it() is where your individual tests are performed. You would use a describe() to indicate that that section of the test suite is going to be testing a certain endpoint. Inside the describe(), you would have one or more it(), depending on how many tests you need to do for that section of the test suite.`

1. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

`The point of Test Driven Development is to have the developer know what the desired outcome of their code should be. That way they know exactly what they need to code, rather than starting to code before really understanding what the code needs to do. I definitely see the benefits of TDD. It will just take a while to get in the testing mindset and to get proficient with testing tools.`

1. Mention three types of automated tests.

`Three types of automated testing are: unit tests, component testing, and integration testing. Unit tests are done done by the developer to make sure the pieces of code that they have written work as designed. Integration testing is the next step, when different peices of a project are tested with each other to make sure they function properly together. Component testing is similar to unit testing, but in our case, component testing refers to testing react components and making sure they behave as designed.`
